== Hackaphoto - A Demo "Hackathon" App

I wrote this little example in less than six hours just to get back into the swing of doing a hackathon-style coding project.  There probably isn't much here worth copying other than maybe the Tumblr OmniAuth strategy that works with 1.0.  Other than that, I think I'd skip this one.

=== Installation

You need to set two environment variables: *TUMBLR_KEY* and *TUMBLR_SECRET* with your OAuth key and secret you get from the Tumblr API (http://www.tumblr.com/oauth/apps).  

I've currently got them set in my .powenv file in my app directory, but of course, that will only work if you're using Pow.

Other than that, it should just "work". It forces you to authenticate against Tumblr and give permission and then starts loading photos from your tumblr dashboard.  I know, it's really simple.  I would have done more, but the OmniAuth strategy took longer than I expected.
